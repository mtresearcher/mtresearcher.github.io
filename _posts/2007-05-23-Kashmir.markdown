title: Kashmir : A stairway to heaven
---
Last summers we went to kashmir with some unaccompanied minors 

A short review of our journey 
Jaipur -> Jammu -> Srinagar -> Sonmarg -> Patnitop -> Bak to pavilion 

Journey to Jammu

First Day :

we were pretty much tired after a long tiring journey in the sleeper class 
well jammu is not different as we think 
jammu's weather and jaipur's there isn't much of a difference plus its not much above sea level 

Way to Heaven's Door!!!

Journey ran through the hilly areas as we took the road we saw that all of it was inhabited by the jawans of the force 
either side was the doorway to heaven ( literal sense ) i mean either side there was danger man!! drivers are so impeccable they drove as they already knew the accurate measurement of the roads 
on the highway sides were covered by pine tress I was mesmerized by the scenery and the fog added to its exquisiteness finally we reached our station 
ah!!! Srinagar so much green i was amazed to c this much of greenry hey!! i belong to rajasthan !! ( an obvious reason ) 

next day we all had to wake up early so that v can visit all the picturesque sites 

Actually its not in my hands to narrate the beauty that i saw there or to say i m not the right one 

Frankly speakin all the gardens appeared same for me 
They were all design in same old fashioned way the staircase types but were looking fabulous as they all counted on the marvelous creations The TULIPS 

We visited these many places in srinagar 

 1 Chasmeshahi Garden: Black Rose it is said that the person who sees a black rose is lucky leave it!! even that black rose couldnt change my luck!! 

 2 Shalimar and Nishat Garden: built by some maharaja in some century one of them had a “chinar tree” it is good for health of a diabetic patient to sit under the tree 

 3 Parimahal Garden: i forgot about this place but i can tell u that it was equally good 

 4 Dal Lake: water skiing shikara house boats floating market vr all fun it reminds me of their culture 

 5 Shankara Charya Temple: gives a panaromic view of the city jhelum can be seen as a snake whirling around the city 

No destination was quite so romantic, no setting was as enchanting as Srinagar More or less in the center of Kashmir, Srinagar's allure changes with the passing of each season Srinagar is as much imagination as it is fact, for every season offers new vistas to this city of great antiquity Spring breathes life again into a frozen world, and the air is heady with the fragrance of a million flowers that blossom on trees, shrubs and creepers Summer heightens the effect, and autumn is poignant in its colors of warm introspection Winter brings with it snow, sometimes the Dal Lake freezes, and beneath a leaden sky, roasted chestnuts turn the atmosphere aromatic with the promise of warmth and comfort 

That was all of it in short 

You must visit kashmir atleast once in ur lifetime 

PS : we visited sonmarg too but it will be too long if i mention it here
