The present work attempts to build an automatic translation system of nominal compound (NC) from
English to Hindi. A noun compound is a sequence of nouns acting as a single noun, e.g., colon cancer,
suppressor protein, colon cancer tumor suppressor protein. They comprise 3.9% and 2.6% of all tokens
in the Reuters corpus and the British National Corpus (BNC), respectively. As of today, no good system
exists for the translation of multi-word expressions from English to any Indian languages. We have
evaluated two state-of-the-art systems, Moses and Google Translation system, to check the Noun Compound 
translation accuracy from English to Hindi. Google translation system results in an accuracy of
57% while Moses, a statistical machine translation system, returns an accuracy of 48% on a test data of
300 Noun Compounds. The above Ô¨Ågures indicate that automatic NC translation from English to Hindi
is an important subtask of machine translation system. We build a Noun Compound Translation system
(NCT) which returns an accuracy of 64% on the same set of test data.
