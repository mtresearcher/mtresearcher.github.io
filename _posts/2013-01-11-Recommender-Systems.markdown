title: A bit on Recommender System
---
In this paper we use the statistics provided by a
ﬁeld experiment to explore the utility of supplying machine
translation suggestions in a computer-assisted translation (CAT)
environment. Regression models are trained for each user
in order to estimate the time to edit (TTE) for the
current translation segment. We use a combination of features
from the current segment and aggregated features from
formerly translated segments selected with content-based ﬁltering
approaches commonly used in recommendation systems. We
present and evaluate decision function heuristics to determine
if machine translation output will be useful for the translator
in the given segment. We ﬁnd that our regression models do
a reasonable job for some users in predicting TTE given only
a small number of training examples; although noise in the
actual TTE for seemingly similar segments yields large error
margins. We propose to include the estimation of TTE in
CAT recommendation systems as a well-correlated metric for
translation quality.
