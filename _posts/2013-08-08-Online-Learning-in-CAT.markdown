title: Online Learning Approaches in CAT
---

We present a novel online learning approach for statistical machine translation
tailored to the computer assisted translation scenario. With the introduction of
a simple online feature, we are able to
adapt the translation model on the ï¬‚y
to the corrections made by the translators. Additionally, we do online adaption
of the feature weights with a large margin algorithm. Our results show that our
online adaptation technique outperforms
the static phrase based statistical machine
translation system by 6 BLEU points absolute, and a standard incremental adaptation
approach by 2 BLEU points absolute.
