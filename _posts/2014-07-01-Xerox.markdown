title: Building an in-domain SMT system without in-domain parallel data
---
We address a challenging problem frequently faced by MT service 
providers: creating a domain-specific system based on a purely 
source-monolingual sample of text from the domain. We solve this 
problem by introducing methods for domain adaptation requiring 
no in-domain parallel data. Our approach yields results comparable
to state-of-the-art systems optimized on an in-domain parallel 
set with a drop of as little as 0.5 BLEU points across 4 domains.
